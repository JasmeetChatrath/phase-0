How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can use Chrome's Devtools to help format elements by editing it live on the page.  This allows you to make quick adjustments to your code which ultimately saves time.  For newer programers like us it also helps improve our understanding of the code.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can do so by going to our CSS code through inspect element and adjusting it directly there.  In this challenge we used height and width to adjust the size of our elements.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute positioning positions the element in relation to the first element that doesn't have static positioning.  Fixed positioning fixes the selector to the browser and removes it from the flow of where it normally would be.  Static just means the element would go where it normally would.  Relative positioning tells the element to relative to where it would have if it had the default static positioning.  I found static and fixed the easiest to use and relative and absolute more difficult.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
The border is the edge of the element.  The padding is the space between the content and the border. The margin is the space around the element.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
This challege was helpful in solidifying our knowledge of positioning.  I have no strong feelings either way.  It was pretty straight forward.
