##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby ignores the remainder of calculations and rounds down.

##What is the difference between integers and floats?
In integer is any whole number (ex: 4, -231, 0) and a float is a number with a decimal place (ex: 4.4, -100.00).

##What is the difference between float and integer division?
Float division simply calculates the number like a calculator would.  Integer division on the other hand rounds down (ex: 20/3 will print 6)

```
puts 24*365
puts 60*24*365*10
```

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
A string is a sequence of characters between '' or "".

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
A local variable starts with a lowercase letter or underscore and consists of letters.  They live inside the method.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
I am still trying to get used to rspec but the challenge itself was straight forward.
