• What does puts do?
Puts returns nil and writes out the output to our console with a new line.
• What is an integer? What is a float?
In integer is any whole number (ex: 4, -231, 0) and a float is a number with a decimal place (ex: 4.4, -100.00).
• What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division simply calculates the number like a calculator would.  Integer division on the other hand rounds down (ex: 20/3 will print 6)

```
puts 24*365
puts 60*24*365*10
```
