Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on Github we got to github.com/new and set the repository name to your_github_name.github.io.  We check the box to either public or private based on our preferences.  We then check the box next to "initialize this repository with a README" and then add the MIT license from the dropdown menu.  If we go to "issues" under "settings" and click the box it will allow others to give feedback.  The clone the repository by copying the clone URL listed on our site and entering it into our terminal using the following command: git clone (insert copied URL here).  If we run “ls” after this we will see a folder with the same name as the repo you cloned.  We can navigate into this folder using “cd”.

Describe what open source means.
Open source means sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.  In other words, an open source license allows software to be freely used, modified, and shared.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I believe that open source can be extremely beneficial if using the correct license based on the programmers needs.  It allows for an open forum of creativity and support.  Seeing how other programmers tackle your code and suggest improvements allows you to not only expand your knowledge of coding but also your way of thinking.  That aspect of it does feel like utopia.  What makes me nervous is my confusion with the rules and regulations involved with open source.  I want to be sure to protect certain aspects of my work.  I believe this discomfort will decrease over time as I gain experience using open source material.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licensing grants specific permission for others to use your work and build on your code.  If you just release your work you relinquish any copyright and no one is obligated to list you as the original contributor. Licensing protects you as the original creator as well as allows others to help you.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Concepts that were solidified in this challenge were the ideas of open source as well as licensing and the various forms of it.  I also felt comfortable creating a repository in Github.  My 'aha' moment came when grasping open source and the benefits behind it.  I felt very comfortable with that topic and I'm excited to learn more about it.
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did not use any other resources besides the ones provided.
