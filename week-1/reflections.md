# H2 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

After reviewing the resources provided discussing productivity, time management, and mindfulness I decided to do more research on meditation, the Pomodoro technique, and counter-intuitive productivity. I decided to do more research on these topics because they really resonated with me and my current struggles. I find myself feeling anxious, stressed, and oftentimes over or under planning. Combining these three topics could drastically improve my quality of life and my productivity as a whole.

The counter-intuitive productivity article made the biggest difference for me. I realized I have a tendency to create unrealistic expectations for myself in so many ways. It’s not realistic to go from 1 hour of studying a day to 7. It’s not healthy to base my day on how much I got done. What’s the point of it all if I don’t enjoy any of what I’m doing? I learned that increasing self-care and doing things I care about should be given value as well. My definition of a successful day shouldn’t be how many hours of work I got in. This article provided an awakening that I needed!

I also loved the idea of the Pomodoro technique. This technique is a form of timeboxing. Incorporating a timebox allocates a fixed period of time toward achieving a goal. The Pomodoro technique uses deadlines along with 25-minute increments to achieve the desired effect. When the agreed upon time is completed you stop working and reflect on what has been accomplished. You look if the goal has been met. This approach has been proven to significantly improve productivity.

My current time management system fluctuates a great deal in terms of productivity. I try to get as much work done as I can in one sitting and take breaks when I get tired. This has proven to not be consistently reliable. To improve my productivity as well as quality of life I plan on implementing timeboxing and meditation. I’ve downloaded the headspace app to assist with meditation and have set aside times throughout the week to work on it. I begin this weekend! I will incorporate timeboxing by setting aside two chunks in the day to study. I will work with a specific goal in mind with a certain time in mind. I do believe implementing these strategies will help me make my way through phase 0 in a more efficient manner.

# H2 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is any software that provides an interface to an operating system.   In the context of software, shell is usually taken to mean a command-line interpreter. Bash is a well-known type of shell and comes default on OS X. Unlike a graphical shell, bash is entirely text based. We are able to enter commands to search through our computer, edit/sort files, search inside of files, and so much more. Simply put, it is a powerful and efficient way to control the beast that is your computer!

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
I felt very confident with the material to begin with. I am able to move through my files, rename them, delete them, list them, and so on with ease. The material I wish to learn more about is piping and redirection, echo and export, and the wildcard matching section. In these areas I was making it through the material and grasping the overall concepts, but implementing them later would be a struggle. I tried researching examples and finding further resources to help without success.   I think it comes down to just needing more practice and experimenting with the commands until it clicks.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
I felt very confident with the material to begin with. I am able to move through my files, rename them, delete them, list them, and so on with ease. I struggled with pipes and redirection, echo and export, and the wildcard matching section.   The concepts of these didn’t seem to sink in like the others did. I plan to attend office hours in an hour to clarify these concepts which should help a lot!

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
I’m struggling with this question because my understanding of the commands is still in progress. From what I’ve seen so far, the command that allow you to page through files, adjust them, and search through them have a lot of power. These commands include mkdir, cd, ls, rmdir, rm, touch, mv, and many more! It allows the coder to quickly access material, which is an efficient way for programmers to make the necessary adjustments and find files quickly. Another really powerful set of commands are find and grep.   These allow you to quickly filter through directories and inside files for specific parameters.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd: print working directory

-ls: list directory

-mv: rename file or directory

-cd: change directory

-../: go back a directory

-touch: makes an empty file

-mkdir: makes a directory

-less: opens the contents of a file in its own window

-rmdir: removes a directory

-rm: removes a file

-help: helps us find the name of a command

# H2 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
Got to your github profile and click on the “+” next to your avatar. Select “New Repository” from the dropdown menu.   Enter the name you would like to use for your repository under “Repository name”. Select public for your repository’s visibility. Add an “MIT License” by clicking on the dropdown menu “Add a license”. Click “Create repository”. To fork a repository go to the github page you want to work on and click on the “Fork” button on the top right hand corner. When the “Where should we fork this repository?” page pops up select your GitHub username. You should now be on your Github page with the forked repository. To clone this repository we copy the HTTPS clone URL located on the right side of the page. Open terminal and go to the folder you want to clone the repository to. Enter “git clone paste_url_here”. It is now on your computer in the folder you’ve selected. We fork a repository instead of creating our own because it creates a path to the master copy. This allows sumbit changes to the master branch when needed.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
Thankfully I did not have any difficulties setting up git or GitHub. The directions were very through and supported with detailed video which make the process very smooth. It’s helped me gain an understanding of how git and Github work together. It’s also helped me get familiarized with the basics of how to use these two amazing resources together. I’ve learned how to use git in terminal. I’ve also learned how to comfortably fork, clone, and set up a repository. This knowledge has created a foundation of learning and I’m very excited to continue to expand my knowledge on both git and Github.
