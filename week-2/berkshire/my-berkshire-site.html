<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It felt relatively straightforward.  I felt comfortable with most tags in HTML so this challenge went pretty smoothly.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researching HTML5 was also pretty straightforward.  We didn’t have any issues.  I loved using the HTML validation tool.  It is a great and easy resource to check your code.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We did well and keeping to best practices with this challenge.  It seemed to come naturally so we didn’t run into any issues.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
To be honest I’ve just gotten used to HTML so it seems convenient and straightforward. Because of this I don’t really have anything to critique about HTML.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
The tags themselves are simple and easy to remember.  When it comes to which tags close which way I do catch myself double-checking with my notes time to time.  With practice I will ge them all down.
