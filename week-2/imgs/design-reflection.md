. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The phases of web design are information gathering, planning, design, development, testing/delivery and maintenance.
. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
I’d like it to act as a solid portfolio of my work. I’d like it to feature projects and links to my social networks and blog.
. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience would be other developers as well as any possible employers in tech.
. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary actions would be to see my portfolio as well as to contact me with any tech related opportunities.
. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
You should know to consider accessibility, target audience, content, guide patterns, consistency, and user flow. They should use A/B testing to compare layouts and see which ones is easier to use and creates the best feel for the user.  Basically, they should know to implement everything they can to create the best possible experience for the user.
. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience (UX experience) is how a person feels when interfacing with the system.  We look at ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth.  It can make the difference between a successful business or a failed one.
. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found getting through the Design for Performance article tedious to get through.  There was a lot of information to take in but it was helpful.  Besides that I felt that I flowed through the lesson efficiently.
